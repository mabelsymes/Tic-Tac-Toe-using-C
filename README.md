# Tic-Tac-Toe-using-C

A tic-tac-toe game in C that can allow player vs player games and player vs computer games. If you choose to play the computer, you can decide whether to be player 1 or player 2. The computer uses the minimax algorithm to decide the best move to make.

Place all files in the same directory. To run, ensure you are in the directory and enter `mingw32-make` into the terminal. You will need to have mingw32-make installed. I followed a YouTube tutorial for setting up my VSCode environment for programming in C:
"How to Set up Visual Studio Code for C and C++ Programming" by Code Bear

A fun first project using C!
