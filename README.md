# Tic-Tac-Toe-using-C

A tic-tac-toe game in C that can allow player vs player games and player vs computer games. If you choose to play the computer, you can decide whether to be player 1 or player 2. The computer uses the minimax algorithm to decide the best move to make.

To run the game on Windows:
1. Place all files in the same directory.
2. Ensure you have a C compiler such as MinGW installed. I followed a YouTube tutorial to set up my VSCode environment for programming in C:
"How to Set up Visual Studio Code for C and C++ Programming" by Code Bear
3. Enter the directory where the files are and enter `mingw32-make` (adapting the number for the version of MinGW that you have) into the terminal.
4. After compilation has finished, type `.\tic_tac_toe` into the terminal. This should run the program with the starting prompt: "Do you want to play with a person or the computer? Enter 'p' for person and 'c' for computer."
5. Enjoy the game!
